 DH_germany_rk.1.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Ostland"
 DH_germany_rk.1.d:0 "The Baltics and Belarus have come under military jurisdication, prompting the question of what should be done with the region.

 DH_germany_rk.3.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Moskowien"
 DH_germany_rk.3.d:0 "The core lands of the Soviet Union are now under our control, and with a mostly Russian ethnic make up it could spell years of social unrest.

 DH_germany_rk.3.a:0 "Establish the Reichskommissariat."
 DH_germany_rk.3.b:0 "Continue Military Occupation."

As long as our military and industry retain access to the rich oil fields in the south."

 DH_germany_rk.7.t:0 "Reichsprotektorat Schweland"

 DH_germany_rk.7.b:0 "Continue Military Occupation."
 
 DH_germany_rk.8.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Ural"
 DH_germany_rk.8.d:0 "Beyond the Ural Mountains lies the vast expanse of forests, rivers, and plains, filled with the riches of mother nature. A wilderness that stretches for thousands of kilometres, only to be sparsely interrupted by human activity. Ruling such an enormous region is difficult enough, let alone for the army. Perhaps it would be best to establish some form of government."

 DH_germany_rk.9.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Siberien"
