They have high speed and good maneuverability to make them agile enough to evade the machine guns of the bombers, while having the firepower needed to disable a heavy, armored bomber. Against enemy fighters, they are less effective yet they still put up a good fight."

 transport_plane_equipment_desc:0 "Transport Planes are designed to ferry men and materials over long distances quickly. Paratroops need Transport Planes in order to make a paradrop."
 
 guided_missile:0 "Rocket"
 guided_missile_desc:0 "The Ballistic Missile is designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a distant target. Its high speed makes it almost impossible to intercept but it is an expensive way of destroying the enemy with conventional explosives. Nuclear weapons are needed to give it more than psychological effect."

 rocket_interceptor_equipment:0 "Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_equipment_desc:0 "A rocket-powered aircraft uses a rocket for propulsion. Rocket planes can achieve much higher speeds than similarly sized jet aircraft, but typically for at most a few minutes of powered operation, followed by a glide. Unhindered by the need for oxygen from the atmosphere they are suitable for very high altitude flight. They are also capable of delivering much higher acceleration and shorter takeoffs."

 rocket_interceptor:0 "Rocket Interceptor"
 rocket_interceptor_desc:0 "Rocket-powered interceptor aircraft based on gliders can, for short periods of time, move faster than any other plane. While volatility of the fuel puts the planes at risk, they can take off and react to attacks faster than any enemy will expect."
 rocket_interceptor_2:0 "Rocket Interceptor II"
 rocket_interceptor_2_desc:0 "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximize the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."

 nuclear_propulsion:0 "Nuclear Propulsion"
 
 NUKE_NAVY_SPECIAL:0 "/n Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear power plant. The power plant heats water to produce steam and it is this steam that powers the steam turbines and turbo generators. The power is then transferred to a gearbox that reduces the ratio by around 50 to 1 and this powers the propulsor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers and submarines."
